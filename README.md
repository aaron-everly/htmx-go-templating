### Exploration of using a combination of go, postgres, prisma, and htmx to develop a web app. 

### How to
`go run main.go`

#### To-do's:
- Hook up endpoints, build out crud, make interesting

#### Ideas:
Shell script could copy an html file that you deem reusable (i.e. modal.html), strip all text between the tags and replace with comments that say to "Add stuff here". Somehow do this with functional aspects of the component, like strip `hx-post` of a value and leave something there to let you know you need to change it.
